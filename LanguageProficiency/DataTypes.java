/*
  Java has 8 primitive data types; char, boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. For this exercise, we'll work with the primitives used to hold integer values (byte, short, int, and long):

  A byte is an 8-bit signed integer.
  A short is a 16-bit signed integer.
  An int is a 32-bit signed integer.
  A long is a 64-bit signed integer.

  Given an input integer, you must determine which primitive data types are capable of properly storing that input.
  To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor.
